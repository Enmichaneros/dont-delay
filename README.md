# Don't Delay
### Visualizing time delays on airplane flights over time.

This was a short solo project for HackHERS2018. Using [WilliamChart](https://github.com/diogobernardino/WilliamChart), a data visualization library for Android, and a dataset on [airline delayed flights](https://data.world/data-society/airlines-delay), I created a simple app that could let you see how the various factors in flight delay compared to one another, and calculated some numbers as well.

While this example is very basic, it does serve as a solid template for future statistics projects in Android.
